This source folder contains the JS-Agent of inspectIT written in typescript.
It is best to use Visual Studio Code as IDE:
https://code.visualstudio.com/
Also install the TSLint for Visual Studio Code:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint
Afterwards you can just open the src/main/ts with VS Code, it will automatically detect all build settings.
