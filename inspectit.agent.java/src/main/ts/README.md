# IDE Setup for the End User Monitoring Agent
This source folder contains the JS-Agent of inspectIT written in typescript.
It is best to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE.
Also install the [TSLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) to enable style checking of your code.
Afterwards you can just open *src/main/ts* with VS Code, it will automatically detect all build settings.
