## Overview
inspectIT (http://inspectit.rocks) is the leading Open Source APM (application performance management) tool for monitoring and analyzing your Java(EE) software applications.

Various sensors capture end-to-end information for every request from the end user, to the business tier all the way to the backends. inspectIT is based on an application-centric, business-focused approach, where each technical request is mapped to an application and to a business usecase. With inspectIT you always know about the health of your software and can easily analyze any problems that arise.

We hope that together we can build an alternative to the (great!) commercial tools available so that it is up the end user to choose his tooling. **Let's make inspectIT even more awesome!**

## Features
- Detailed trace representation (invocation sequence) for every request containing all interactions with the systems.
- Automatic enrichment of every trace with HTTP information, SQL queries, exceptions, parameters and many more.
- Detailed exception capturing allows to analyze functional problems.
- Drill down into one invocation sequence to find and analyze problematic requests.
- Drill up from an problem within an invocation sequence and find business-related information like the URL the  request was sent to.
- Aggregated views for every captured metric, e.g. [aggregated SQL overview](http://inspectit.github.io/inspectIT/screenshots/sqlOverviewWithStorage.png) shows metrics aggregated by SQL query.
- Navigation feature allows to navigate between aggregated views and invocation sequences for advanced analytics.
- Talk in invocation sequences! Send detailed traces with all information instead of noting down which clicks lead to the problem.
- Reproducing problems is a thing of the past! You already have a trace representation that you can analyze.
- No more config files! We have graphical configuration interfaces for everything.
- Easy and transparent integration of the inspectIT agents in the application.
- Monitor your hardware metrics like cpu, memory or threads.
- Optimized for low overhead.
- Production-proof: Used for >8 years at our customers and during performance firefights
- One server is enough for most environments supporting a big number of agents.  
- RESTful API for automation and integration with other tools.
- Fully adaptable user interface.
- Extensible system: Missing something? Write your own extensions.

### Out-of-the-box profiles
inspectIT already ships with out-of-the-box instrumentations for commonly used Java technologies.

- Tomcat
- Glassfish
- Any plain java application


### Related projects
- Experimental features and supporting components of inspectIT are located at [inspectIT Labs]( https://github.com/inspectIT-labs)
- Our Docker integration projects are located at [inspectIT Docker](https://github.com/inspectit-docker)


## Integration
The integration of inspectIT in your application is completely transparent, you do not have to change a single line of code. The only thing you have to do is to place our agent with your application and integrate it into your startup script.

The integration is as simple as adding the following to the startup of your application.

```
-javaagent:[INSPECTIT_AGENT_HOME]/inspectit-agent.jar -Dinspectit.repository=[REPOSITORY_IP]:[REPOSITORY_PORT] -Dinspectit.agent.name=[AGENT_DISPLAY_NAME]
```

The [end user documentation](https://inspectit-performance.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/End+User+Documentation+Home) provides in-depth documentation on the installation of inspectIT for all supported platforms. If you have further questions please get in touch with us.
